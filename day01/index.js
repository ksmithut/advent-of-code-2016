 * --- Day 1: No Time for a Taxicab ---
 *
 * Santa's sleigh uses a very high-precision clock to guide its movements, and
 * the clock's oscillator is regulated by stars. Unfortunately, the stars have
 * been stolen... by the Easter Bunny. To save Christmas, Santa needs you to
 * retrieve all fifty stars by December 25th.
 *
 * Collect stars by solving puzzles. Two puzzles will be made available on each
 * day in the advent calendar; the second puzzle is unlocked when you complete
 * the first. Each puzzle grants one star. Good luck!
 *
 * You're airdropped near Easter Bunny Headquarters in a city somewhere. "Near",
 * unfortunately, is as close as you can get - the instructions on the Easter
 * Bunny Recruiting Document the Elves intercepted start here, and nobody had
 * time to work them out further.
 *
 * The Document indicates that you should start at the given coordinates (where
 * you just landed) and face North. Then, follow the provided sequence: either
 * turn left (L) or right (R) 90 degrees, then walk forward the given number of
 * blocks, ending at a new intersection.
 *
 * There's no time to follow such ridiculous instructions on foot, though, so
 * you take a moment and work out the destination. Given that you can only walk
 * on the street grid of the city, how far is the shortest path to the
 * destination?
 *
 * For example:
 *
 * Following R2, L3 leaves you 2 blocks East and 3 blocks North, or 5 blocks
 * away.
 * R2, R2, R2 leaves you 2 blocks due South of your starting position, which is
 * 2 blocks away.
 * R5, L5, R5, R3 leaves you 12 blocks away.
 * How many blocks away is Easter Bunny HQ?

 * Document. Easter Bunny HQ is actually at the first location you visit twice.
 *

 * visit twice is 4 blocks away, due East.
