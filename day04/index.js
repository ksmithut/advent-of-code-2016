 * --- Day 4: Security Through Obscurity ---
 *
 * Finally, you come across an information kiosk with a list of rooms. Of
 * course, the list is encrypted and full of decoy data, but the instructions to
 * decode the list are barely hidden nearby. Better remove the decoy data first.
 *
 * Each room consists of an encrypted name (lowercase letters separated by
 * dashes) followed by a dash, a sector ID, and a checksum in square brackets.
 *
 * A room is real (not a decoy) if the checksum is the five most common letters
 * in the encrypted name, in order, with ties broken by alphabetization. For
 * example:
 *
 * aaaaa-bbb-z-y-x-123[abxyz] is a real room because the most common letters are
 * a (5), b (3), and then a tie between x, y, and z, which are listed
 * alphabetically.
 * a-b-c-d-e-f-g-h-987[abcde] is a real room because although the letters are
 * all tied (1 of each), the first five are listed alphabetically.
 * not-a-real-room-404[oarel] is a real room.
 * totally-real-room-200[decoy] is not.
 * Of the real rooms from the list above, the sum of their sector IDs is 1514.
 *
 * What is the sum of the sector IDs of the real rooms?

/**
 * --- Part Two ---
 *
 * With all the decoy data out of the way, it's time to decrypt this list and
 * get moving.
 *
 * The room names are encrypted by a state-of-the-art shift cipher, which is
 * nearly unbreakable without the right software. However, the information kiosk
 * designers at Easter Bunny HQ were not expecting to deal with a master
 * cryptographer like yourself.
 *
 * To decrypt a room name, rotate each letter forward through the alphabet a
 * number of times equal to the room's sector ID. A becomes B, B becomes C, Z
 * becomes A, and so on. Dashes become spaces.
 *
 * For example, the real name for qzmt-zixmtkozy-ivhz-343 is very encrypted
 * name.
 *
 * What is the sector ID of the room where North Pole objects are stored?
